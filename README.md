# Manufacturing Facility Simulation

Welcome to the Manufacturing Facility Simulation project! This project uses SimPy, a process-based discrete-event simulation framework based on Python, to model and simulate the operations of a manufacturing facility. The simulation results are exported to a web dashboard, providing an interactive and visual representation of the manufacturing processes. The web dashboard is scripted in JavaScript.

## Overview

This project aims to simulate the workflows within a manufacturing facility, capturing key operations, resources, and performance metrics. The simulation results are displayed on a dynamic web dashboard to provide insights and enable better decision-making.

## Features

- **Discrete-Event Simulation**: Utilizes SimPy to model manufacturing processes.
- **Resource Management**: Simulates the allocation and utilization of resources such as machines and workers.
- **Process Flows**: Models various production stages, including assembly, quality control, and packaging.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A web-based dashboard that visualizes simulation results.
- **Data Export**: Exports simulation data to be visualized on the web dashboard.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Node.js and npm (for the web dashboard)
